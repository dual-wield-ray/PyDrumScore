Contributing
============

.. include:: contentheader.rst

If you would like to contribute to the project, you can fork the repo on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/dual-wield-ray/PyDrumScore>`_. You can find a detailed guide explaining the process in the `GitHub docs <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects>`_.
Being a pure Python distribution, there is no code to compile; simply execute::

    python -m pydrumscore your_filename

in the root directory

As the project is still in its early stages, it is a bit early for code changes.
Here are the best ways you can help the project:

- Try following tutorials and scoring your own songs, and provide user feedback.
- Indicate sections of the documentation that are unclear
- Make feature propositions (TODO link)

.. warning:: **Before filling a bug report or feature proposition**, make sure it doesn't already exist in the planned features or known limitations sections. As PyDrumScore is still in early development, many issues are already known, and features planned for official releases.

    Doing this will save you time and frustration!

Feature propositions
--------------------
If you have an idea for a feature (whether you intend to develop it or not), there are a few guidelines to follow.
